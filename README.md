#### The IPL Score Predictor project is about predicting score of batting team.
#### This web application have IPL 2022 teams where you can predict score of batting team.

## Overview
- I have IPL matches records from year 2008 to 2020.
- I have trained machine learning model for 8 teams which were playing in year 2021.
- Here i have performed hyperparameter tunning on various model and i got **Random Forest** as best model for this problem statement.
- Gradient Booost algorithm gives **0.850539 r2_score** & **1.632532 MAE** on train dataset and **0.871335 r2_score** & **6.438084 MAE** on test dataset.
- Random Forest algorithm gives **0.672894 r2_score** & **11.296707 MAE** on train dataset and **0.681484 r2_score** & **12.173585 MAE** on test dataset.
- Difference of train dataset MAE and test dataset MAE is **4.805552** for Gradient Boost.
- Difference of train dataset MAE and test dataset MAE is **0.876878** for Random Forest.
- Here accuracy or **r2_score** of Gradient Boost algorithm is higher than Random Forest but Random Forest's **MAE** difference between train and test dataset is lower than Gradient Boost.
- If i select Gradient Boost algorithm which has high r2_score then our model will **not perform stable** as it performed on train dataset because **MAE** difference between train and test dataset is **high** that's why it might generate **overfitting** issue.
- If i select Radom Forest algorithm which does not have high r2_score still it will perfrom **stable** as it performed on train dataset because MAE difference between train and test dataset is **low**.
- Here i have selected **Random Forest** algorithm with it's hyperparamter which best fit for this problem statement with around **68%** of accuracy.
- Application developed using Flask, Javascript, Bootstrap, CSS and HTML

## Data Source
- In this project i have used IPL dataset from kaggle, you can get it from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020)


## How to use
- Select venue, batting team, bowling tean and fill the inputs with proper information then click on predict button you will get predicted score of batting team.
